# ia-python-projects

Various projects completed in Python during my IASD training.

* Go-playing neural network.

* Linear optimization program designed to determine the line that maximizes the distance between itself and the closest data point on each side.

* Research work on diffusion models (presentation, applications, and challenges).

* Manipulation of datasets with DELTA LAKE.

* Training of generative chatbot-type models for software developers.

* Apache Spark to identify direct or indirect connections between individuals in a large data network.


Coming soon

* Recommendation program based on H&M transaction dataset.

* Constrained models for network robustness against adversarial attacks: verification of Lipschitz models, presentation, performance, and costs.

* Scala program for calculating the page rank of Wikipedia pages.

* Spark Scala program for estimating flight delays based on weather conditions at departure and destination airports.
