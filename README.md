# ia-python-projects

Various projects completed in Python during my IASD training.

* Go-playing neural network

* Linear optimization program designed to determine the line that maximizes the distance between itself and the closest data point on each side

* Research work on diffusion models (presentation, applications, and challenges)

* Manipulation of datasets with DELTA LAKE

* Training of generative chatbot-type models for software developers

* Ce projet utilise Apache Spark pour identifier les connexions directes ou indirectes entre individus dans un grand réseau de données.


Coming soon

* Recommendation program based on H&M transaction dataset

* Constrained models for network robustness against adversarial attacks: verification of Lipschitz models, presentation, performance, and costs.
